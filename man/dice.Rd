\title{Dice Roll}
\usage{
dice(sides = 6)
}
\arguments{
\item{sides}{The number of sides on the dice to roll. Traditionally the values
are 4, 6 \strong{default}, 8, 12, 20, and 100, with six being the most common.
The value should be an interger of value greater than or equal to 2.
#'}
}
\value{
A random interger with a value between 1 and N inclusive.
}
\description{
\code{dice} returns a random interger with values between 1 and N, simulating
a roll of a single fair N sided die.
}
\details{
\code{dice} utilizes the runif function to achive the output and therefor
can be made repeatable but utilizing the \link[base]{set.seed} functionality.
While reproducability is needed at times this should only be utilized sparingly
and with caution because when used the \code{dice} becomes no longer "fair."
}
\examples{
dice()
dice(sides = 6)
dice(sides = 25)
